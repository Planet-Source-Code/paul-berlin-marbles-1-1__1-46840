Marbles 1.1
Paul Berlin 2003

IMPORTANT INFO
--------------
Marbles takes use of the fmod sound library from
Firelight Technologies and requires the fmod.dll
file. It can be downloaded from the fmod website
at http://www.fmod.org or you can rename the 
fmod.dll_ file to fmod.dll.

DirectX 8.1 SDK (or higher) is required if
you want to compile Marbles. It can be downloaded
from the microsoft website.

There is also an compiled version of Marbles
included, renamed to Marbles.exe_ in case
you are having problems compiling.

Look in readme.html for further information.
